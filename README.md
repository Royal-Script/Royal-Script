# Hey, I'm Alireza! ðŸ‘‹  

## About Me  
I'm a developer who loves solving problems with code. I work with **Lua**, **PHP**, and **Python**, and I enjoy building cool tools and automating all the boring stuff. I'm always learning and experimenting with new technologies to make things faster, simpler, and more fun!  

Right now, Iâ€™m diving into **HTML** and **CSS** to level up my frontend game. Whether it's backend, frontend, or automating things, Iâ€™m all in for making the web a better place!  

When I'm not coding, I run **Royal Script**, where I create and sell custom scripts to make peopleâ€™s lives easier.  

## Skills & Interests  
- **Languages I Speak:** Lua, PHP, Python  
- **Frontend Development:** Learning **HTML** and **CSS** to create cool websites  
- **Backend Development:** Making stuff work in the background with APIs and automation  
- **Game Dev & Servers:** Messing around with **Fivem** and game server scripting  
- **Automation:** Writing scripts to automate everything I can (because why not?)  

## Royal Script  
I run **Royal Script**, where I make custom scripts for all sorts of needsâ€”whether you need a bot, a game server setup, or anything else! Hit me up if you want something unique built just for you.
